# Project 4 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [X] In the time Stamp, we made it so it shows how long has it been since they have posted the tweet
- [X] Autolayout
- [X] Changed the GUI and the UI. Made it look more like Twitter
- [X] Added a nav bar functionality

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Autolayout
2.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble with AutoLayout.

Autolayout and the GUI was one of the hardest parts of this app.
Also the network authentication was a challange in the beginning
